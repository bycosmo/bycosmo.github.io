title: Why even do this?
description: Frameworks are hard. Meta-frameworks are even harder. And don't get me started on libraries!

It's a tough question to answer. Frameworks aren't an easy thing to make, a lot of decisions need to be made, variables to be named, and then it has to be seen by other people.

So why do it?

Is it to unseat the reigning champion of frameworks? Is it to be the new hot shit? Is it to reach unparalleled amounts of minor internet celebrity fame?

## No.

Want to elaborate on that?

## Not really?

The fact is that there are too many frameworks out there. To say "You should use Cosmo because it is going to solve *insert niche problem here*" would be foolish and ghoulish. But to make a framework without a goal of being "The X but for Y" it makes the project seem aimless.

Sure, you've got a compiler (in progress) and an idea for a spec of the way files will work (in progress), but who cares?

Ideally, I'd love to come here and say "Drop {current hot framework} and never pick it up again because Cosmo is going to make your days so much easier!" but that's a lie.

Everything about what this frameworks goals are makes it harder to justify picking it up. It isn't built in React/Vue/{insert new hot language here}. It is built on single file components. It has it's own custom file type that, even though it compiles down to HTML, needs a compiler.

## You're not really selling yourself here

Yeah, I realize that.

But the truth is that this "framework" is going to help out someone. Even if it doesn't reach heights of Astro or React or Next or jQuery, the goal is to make Web Components better understood.

The joy of Cosmo is the restriction. Everything is a web component. Now make a framework.
